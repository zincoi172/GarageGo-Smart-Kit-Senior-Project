# GarageGo – Dual-Locking Smart Garage Security Kit

GarageGo is a smart, universally compatible IoT garage control system designed for modern security and convenience. Built with C++ on the ESP8266 platform, it merges two independent locking methods — Smart Power-Toggle and Smart Button-Pressed — into one seamless mobile app solution using Blynk.
